                    <h4>When does TerraLux Living launch?</h4>
                    <p>We're launching February 2026. Founding members receive priority access 2-4 weeks early, giving you time to set up before the wider community joins.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What exactly do I receive for $29/month?</h4>
                    <p>Full access to the TerraLux platform, plant monitoring system, air quality awareness tools, Interior World Builder (3D visualization), founding community connection, and 20% off all Homes That Heal transformation services.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What do sensors cost?</h4>
                    <p>Plant sensors are $15 each. Air quality monitors range from $50-200 depending on features. We sell hardware at cost—no markup. You own everything outright.</p>

                    <h4>How do the 20% savings work?</h4>

                    <h4>Do I need plants to participate?</h4>
                    <p>Not at all. While plants reveal fascinating patterns, the air quality monitoring, community access, World Builder, and transformation services all provide value independently.</p>
