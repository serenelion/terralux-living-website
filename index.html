                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>When does the membership launch?</h4>
                    <p>We're targeting February 2026 for our founding member rollout. Waitlist members will be notified 2-4 weeks before launch with priority access.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What exactly am I paying $29/month for?</h4>
                    <p>Access to the TerraLux Home App, Interior World Builder (3D home visualization), global plant database, Living Systems protocol, ongoing updates, and community access. Hardware (sensors) is purchased separately at cost.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How much do the sensors cost?</h4>
                    <p>Plant sensors are $15 each. Environmental monitoring sensors (CO₂, VOCs, particulates) are sold at cost—pricing varies by setup. We're transparent: you own your hardware, and we don't profit from it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Do I need a green thumb to succeed?</h4>
                    <p>No. That's the entire point. The sensors remove the guesswork. You'll know <em>exactly</em> when to water, when to fertilize, and when something's wrong—before it's too late.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I use this in an apartment?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. TerraLux is designed for urban living—balconies, windowsills, countertop systems. Small-footprint growing is where we shine.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What if I already have smart home devices?</h4>
                    <p>TerraLux integrates with existing home automation systems. Our partner Aaron's system connects to standard HVAC, lighting, and security—plus adds plant and air quality layers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is this just for plants, or does it help me?</h4>
                    <p>Both. Plants are the entry point, but the environmental sensors (CO₂, VOCs, particulates) track factors that directly impact <em>your</em> sleep, focus, longevity, and metabolic health.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I cancel anytime?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. TerraLux Living Systems Membership is month-to-month with no long-term commitment. Founding members keep their $29 rate as long as they stay active.</p>
