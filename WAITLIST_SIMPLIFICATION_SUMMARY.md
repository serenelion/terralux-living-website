- Reduced cognitive load

### 🔑 Key Messaging Improvements

#### Old Form Description:
"As you fill out this form, imagine yourself as part of the founding community pioneering Homes That Heal. No payment required now—just your commitment to exploring what's possible."

"Imagine belonging to a curated network of healing homes, biohacking centers, and regenerative villages across 15+ global locations. As a founding member, you'll gain priority access to wellness experiences, transformation services, and a community of visionaries building the future of conscious living."

**Why it works:**
