# Index.html Update — Scout Membership Pre-Sale Alignment

## Overview
Updated index.html to accurately reflect the official Scout Membership Pre-Sale product offering as defined in the TerraLux Living Product Overview document.

---

## Critical Corrections Made

### 1. **Pre-Sale Pricing Structure**
**Before:**  
- "$29/Month • Founding Members" (implied ongoing subscription)
- Unclear when subscription starts

**After:**  
- "$29 Pre-Sale — First 2 Months" (50% discount)
- Clear: "Your subscription begins when the Homes That Heal App launches"
- After 2 months: $29/month or $290/year (save $58)

**Why:** The $29 is a PRE-SALE payment for the first 2 months, not an immediate monthly subscription.

---

### 2. **Sensors Are NOT Included**
**Before:**  
- Made it sound like sensors were included in membership
- "$15 sensors reveal what your plants experience..."

**After:**  
- "Plant & Air Quality Sensors (Available at App Launch)"
- "Sold separately and will be available to order when the app launches"
- Clear pricing: $15 for plant sensors, air quality monitors sold at cost

**Why:** Hardware is a separate purchase, not included in the $29 membership.

---

### 3. **Homes That Heal App (Not Vague "Platform")**
**Before:**  
- Generic references to "TerraLux platform"

**After:**  
- Specific: "Homes That Heal App"
- "Launches post pre-sale"
- "Your subscription begins the moment the app goes live"

**Why:** Product has a specific name and launch timeline.

---

### 4. **Digital Twin Technology**
**Before:**  
- Mentioned "Interior World Builder" (confusing, not in product doc)

**After:**  
- "Digital Twin Technology"
- "The app creates a digital twin of your living space, mapping longevity indicators and environmental health"
- "Plants act as early warning systems for air quality and nutrient density"

**Why:** Official product terminology from the overview doc.

---

### 5. **20% Discount = Marketplace (NOT Services)**
**Before:**  
- "20% off all Homes That Heal services—from discovery to complete transformation"
- Entire section about Discovery/Foundation/Complete Integration services

**After:**  
- "20% member discount on all Homes That Heal Starter Kits, regenerative seeds, wellness devices, and curated products through the TerraLux Home Shop"

**Why:** The 20% discount is for marketplace products, not professional services. Service pricing is not part of Scout Membership.

---

### 6. **Immediate Community Access**
**Before:**  
- Unclear when community access starts

**After:**  
- "Immediate entry into the TerraLux digital community upon pre-sale purchase"
- "Join today—connect with founding members, attend virtual events... while the app is in development"

**Why:** Community access begins immediately, even before app launch.

---

### 7. **Approval-Based Membership**
**Before:**  
- No mention of approval process

**After:**  
- "TerraLux Living is a curated, approval-based community—all applications are reviewed for alignment"
- "If not approved, you'll receive a full refund"
- Added FAQ explaining the policy

**Why:** This is a key differentiator and policy that must be disclosed upfront.

---

### 8. **Membership Ecosystem & Upgrade Path**
**Before:**  
- Only mentioned Scout tier
- No clear upgrade pathway

**After:**  
- Full tier overview: Scout → Rider ($360/mo) → Steward ($1,000/mo)
- Partnership tiers: Shareholder ($25K), Founder ($50K), Village LP ($1M), Strategic GP ($5M)
- "Priority upgrade path" as a membership benefit

**Why:** Scout is the entry point to a seven-tier ecosystem—this context is essential.

---

### 9. **Pre-Sale Process Clarity**
**Before:**  
- Vague "join the waitlist" messaging

**After:**  
- 4-step process:
  1. Join the Pre-Sale ($29 now, applications reviewed)
  2. Get Community Access (immediate)
  3. App Launches (subscription begins, order sensors)
  4. Continue or Upgrade (renew or upgrade to higher tiers)

**Why:** Clear expectations for what happens when.

---

### 10. **Form & CTA Updates**
**Before:**  
- "Join the Founding Community"
- Generic interest questions

**After:**  
- "Join the Pre-Sale — $29"
- Updated interest options: App, Digital Twin, Sensors, Community, Upgrade, Partnership
- Form notes:
  - "$29 locks in your first 2 months (50% off)"
  - "Subscription begins when Homes That Heal App launches"
  - "Then $29/month or $290/year (save $58)"
  - "Approval-based membership — full refund if not approved"

**Why:** Transparent, accurate, aligned with product offering.

## Removed Sections

### ❌ "Homes That Heal Services" (Discovery/Foundation/Complete)
**Why:** These are NOT part of Scout Membership. The 20% discount is for marketplace products, not professional design services. Including this created false expectations about what's included.

### ❌ "Interior World Builder" Detailed Features
**Why:** Product doc mentions "Digital Twin" not "Interior World Builder." Removed confusing terminology and replaced with accurate product language.

---

## Key Messaging Principles Applied

### Transparency First
- Clear about what's included vs. sold separately
- Upfront about approval process and potential refund
- Honest about timeline (app hasn't launched yet)

### Accurate Product Representation
- Used official product names (Homes That Heal App, Digital Twin)
- Correct pricing structure (pre-sale vs. ongoing)
- True membership benefits (marketplace discount, not services)

### Aligned with Product Strategy
- Scout as entry point to ecosystem
- Upgrade path to higher tiers
- Community-building during app development
